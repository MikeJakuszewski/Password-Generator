## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project was designed and built with vanilla javascript functions, HTML, and CSS. I have the program 1Password, this program inspired me to imitate the random password generating component of the program in a project.

## Optimizations

- Add button function to copy password to clipboard
- Change the length of the password
- Add restrictions for character types to be present in passwords


## Lessons Learned:

This was a fun project to recreate a feature I use in 1Password. It helped with my understanding of structuring my functions in JS, using flexbox, and designing this page with HTML and CSS.
